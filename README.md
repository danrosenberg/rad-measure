## RAD Measure

This repository implements tools for general purpose RAD calculation. In particular, it contains specific VQA tools that integrate with our proposed dataset.

Please see our paper for more details: [Are VQA systems RAD? Measuring robustness to augmented data with focused interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04484).
